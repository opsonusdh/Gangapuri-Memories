### 🔑 Password Hints

You thought it’d be easy? Nah. Gangapuri secrets are locked in code and chaos.

1. We say: Tapan ___ -er chele.


2. Think of the teacher whose name is: “Bolo zuban kesri.”


3. The Math sir with a chest so big, you could rest your homework on it.


4. The Geography sir who smiled more in the staffroom than in class in front of female teachers.





### 📖 About This Place

This is not just a website. It’s a time machine.

A collection of inside jokes only Gangapuri students will laugh at.

A vault of memories — both embarrassing and glorious.

A shrine for all the nicknames we threw around without mercy.

A reminder that once you’re a Gangapuri student, you’re always a Gangapuri student.
